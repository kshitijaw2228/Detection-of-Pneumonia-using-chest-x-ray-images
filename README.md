## What Is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs infection can be life-threatening to anyone.

## Chest X-Rays related to Pneumonia disease
An X-ray exam will allow a doctor to see lungs, heart and blood vessels etc to determine the presence of pneumonia.  
Infiltrates that identify an infection.  
Low contrast, overlapping organs and blurred boundary.  
Medical value and application significance to construct a stable and accurate automatic detection model of pneumonia.

## Setup
To run on a normal CPU, having a ‘CUDA’ enabled GPU helps models get trained quicker.  
‘Google’s Colaboratory’ is the developer's best friend when it comes to deep learning.  
Colaboratory is a Google research project created to help machine learning education and research.   
Hosted on Google Cloud instances which we can use for free. 

## Pre-requisites
Good Knowledge of Python programming language.  
In depth knowledge over Linear and Logistic regression.  
Understanding of Basic Image processing. 
Basic Understanding on Artificial neural networks and Convolutional neural networks Working and Implementation.
